# Module 4, Lesson 1: Introduction to animation

This part of the repository contains the script for Module 4, Lesson 1: Introduction to animation. The lesson is an introduction to simple animation. The activity in this lesson is just simple: record an animation clip for both button and blue gate which would be played when the button is pressed. The script, likewise, is just simple as it only details when to enable or disable the animation of both button and gate. The crucial part, however, of the activity is to how record an animation clip for the objects. Most of the activity, therefore, lies in recording the animation clip rather than using the script (the use of the script is just the final part of the activity).

# Guides:

## Quick description about the script

* <b>Button.cs</b> - implements the operation of the button: when pressed, the blue gate opens

## General instructions on using the script

Make sure to create the animations first before using the script. Note that the objects where an animation clip is needed to be recorded is that of the button and the blue gate. Make sure that the initial state of the button is unpressed, and the final state of the button is pressed. As for the blue gate, the initial state is closed and the final state is opened.

For specific details on how to setup the animation as well as how to use the script, a step-by-step guide is provided below.
