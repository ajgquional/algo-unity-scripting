## Quick description about the scripts

* <b>Player.cs</b> - same script as before but now updated to include codes to play a sound effect when the player receives some damage and to restart the level when there's no more health left
* <b>Platform.cs</b> - script to move a platform up or down (as if it's an elevator) when the player rides it; also, the script includes conditions to reverse the platform's direction when the platform touches specified stopping points in the scene
* <b>Timer.cs</b> - adds a countdown timer to the game; when the time reaches zero, the level restarts
* <b>Enemy.cs</b> - same script as before but now updated to catch NullReferenceException error; specifically, a condition is added in the script to check if it's really the player who touches the enemy
