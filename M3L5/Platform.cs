 * Program description: 
 *      This program implements a lift mechanism.
 *      A Platform would take the Player up or down
 *      until a specific point. The Platform would 
 *      only be activated when the Player steps upon it.
 * 
 * How to use the script:
 *      - Setup the lift: there should be a Platform object
 *          and two stop points
 *      - Setup a "PlatformStop" tag and assign it to the
 *          two stop points
 *      - Attach the script to the Platform object
