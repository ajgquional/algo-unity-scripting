 * Program description: 
 *      This program contains improved mechanics for 
 *      the Player: a sound effect would be generated
 *      when the Player attains damage, health goes 
 *      down until zero only, and the level restarts
 *      when the Player's health is zero.
 * 
 * How to use the script:
 *      - Import the necessary sound asset
 *      - Setup the audio source for the Player
 *      - Replace the previous Player script with this one
 *      - Specify the Audio Source and Audio Clip via the Inspector
