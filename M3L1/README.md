# Module 3, Lesson 1: Introduction to the C# language

This part of the repository contains the scripts for Module 3, Lesson 1: Introduction to the C# language. The lesson is only an introduction to C# scripting; thus, the activities in the lesson aren't that overly complicated and not intended to be part of a full game. In general, the activities are about printing a text in the console and learning how to destroy and create game objects using scripts.

## Quick description about the scripts

* <b>HelloWorld.cs</b> - prints the text "Hello, World!" in the Unity Editor console once at the beginning of the game
* <b>Crickets.cs</b> - prints the text "crickets" in the Unity Editor console every frame
* <b>Destroy.cs</b> - destroys the primitive that the script is attached to at the beginning of the game
* <b>CreatePrimitive.cs</b> - creates a figure resembling Steve from Minecraft at the beginning of the game

## General instructions on using the scripts

The scripts in the lesson serve different purposes, as outlined above. To be able to use them, first create a script in an appropriate location in the project, open the script in a Code Editor, and paste the needed program from the scripts in this repository. Finally, attach the script in an appropriate game object.

For specific details on using the scripts, a step-by-step guide is provided below.
